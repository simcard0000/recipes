# recipes
🏺 Recipes from my family and other sources.

### About + Credits
Recipes are written in [CookLang](https://cooklang.org/). Assuming you have [cookcli](https://github.com/cooklang/cookcli) installed: run `cook server` in this directory, then open [http://127.0.0.1:9080](http://127.0.0.1:9080) in your browser.

### To-Do
- [ ] Add VSCode extension for [CookLang syntax highlighting](https://cooklang.org/docs/syntax-highlighting/) and an alias for the `cook` command to [dotfiles](https://github.com/simcard0000/dotfiles).
