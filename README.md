# recipes
🏺 Dishes from my family and other sources.

### About + Credits
Recipes are written in [CookLang](https://cooklang.org/), with [extensions](https://github.com/cooklang/cooklang-rs/blob/main/extensions.md).
> [!WARNING]
> Because the recipes are written in an extended language, they may not appear correctly when rendering them with `cookcli`. For a better experience, please use `cooklang-chef`.
* **with [cookcli](https://github.com/cooklang/cookcli)**: run `cook server` in this directory, then open [http://127.0.0.1:9080](http://127.0.0.1:9080) in your browser.
* **with [cooklang-chef](https://github.com/Zheoni/cooklang-chef)**: add an empty `.cooklang` directory inside this repository, then run `chef serve --open` in this directory, and finally open [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) in your browser.

### To-Do
- [ ] Add VSCode extension for [CookLang syntax highlighting](https://cooklang.org/docs/syntax-highlighting/) and an alias for the `cook` command to [dotfiles](https://github.com/simcard0000/dotfiles).
