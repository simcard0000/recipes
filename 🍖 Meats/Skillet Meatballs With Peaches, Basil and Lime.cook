In a #large bowl{}, mix together @ginger{1½%tablespoons}(finely grated or minced fresh), @garlic cloves{3}(grated or minced), @ground cumin{1¼%teaspoon}(plus more for serving) and @salt{1¼%teaspoon}. 

Add @ground pork{1%pound}(can sub. with turkey or chicken, or vegan meat), @panko{⅓%cup} and @basil{3%tablespoons}(finely chopped and fresh, plus some leaves for serving). Using your hands, gently mix everything together in the large bowl, making sure not to overwork the mixture. (Otherwise, the meatballs get tough.) Form into 1¼-inch balls.

Heat a #large skillet{} over medium-high, then add the @extra-virgin olive oil{2%tablespoons} and let it heat up until it thins out. Add meatballs in one layer. 

Cook, turning and shaking the pan, until meatballs are browned all over, for ~{5%minutes} to ~{7%minutes}.

Pour the @wine{2%tablespoons}(use dry white, rosé or red; or use broth, orange juice or water) into the skillet and move meatballs over to one side of the pan, scraping up the browned bits.

Add @peaches{2%cups}(diced ripe peaches or nectarines), a pinch of salt and @water{2%tablespoons} to the empty side of pan. When peaches are simmering, cover the pan, lower the heat to medium, and let cook until the meatballs are no longer pink at their centers, and the peaches juicy and tender, about ~{5%minutes} to ~{10%minutes} longer.

Uncover the pan. If the mixture seems too runny, let it cook down for another minute or so. The peaches should break down into a chunky sauce. Hard or unripe peaches may take a few extra minutes.

Add the @onions{¼%cup}(thinly sliced white or red onion, or scallions) to the pan and mix them in so they wilt slightly. Squeeze @lime{1, halved} juice all over everything, then taste and add salt and lime juice, as needed. Sweeter peaches will need more lime juice, tart ones, less.

Serve the meatballs sprinkled with more cumin and garnished with torn basil leaves, over @?White rice{} or @?coconut rice{}, @?rice noodles{}, or @?crisp salad greens{}, for serving.
